## Overview

This is the repo for a [freeCodeCamp exercise](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-markdown-previewer) that I decided to do as a stand-alone site so that I could get a bit of practice with the server-side environment while completing this front-end task.

## Stack & infrastructure

1. `yarn` or `npm` can be used for package management, but for the exercise I'll try `npm`.
1. Server is a simple, raw NodeJS implementation serving the static files.
1. I believe Babel will be used for transpilation on the front-end, but that's TBC.
1. There's a stand-alone [test script](https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/testable-projects-fcc/v1/bundle.js) supplied by freeCodeCamp which needs to be added to the pageâ€”this is what determines whether the challenge is complete or not.
1. Front-end libraries are yet to be determined.
